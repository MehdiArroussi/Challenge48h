**where to start ?**
If you want to experiment the project you can try it here, this is the github link : https://github.com/MehdiArroussi/Challenge48h, but you should be able to use VS code to exploit the content. Also a bit of knowledge of PHP and SQL were used to comunicate with the Data Base, JavaScript and HTML/CSS were used to create the website and nodeJS, React, nodeJsReact, typescript were used to create the API and Docker.


**Wanted Idea :**
We got a set of API who got his own Data Base and give the data for the WebSite. all those API can comunicate with the others and ask for data. the model may not be dangered because there is no main API so if an API is shutdown, the other APIs can continue to communicate
